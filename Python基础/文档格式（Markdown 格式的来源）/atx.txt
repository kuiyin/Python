atx, the true structured text format
I鈥檓 sick of bringing my writing down to the level of the computer. Why should I have to cover everything in annoying pointy brackets just so it knows what I mean? We鈥檝e had well-standardized conventions for computer processed text for the past decade; it鈥檚 time for a text format that acknowledges them, instead of inventing its own way of doing things.

I鈥檝e tried to create such a format: atx. The rest of this document describes the conventions of atx in detail, but you should be able to just write as you do in email and have a mostly valid atx document.

Note that atx is still in flux and is subject to change. However, I don鈥檛 expect all that much to change and I鈥檒l note things that I鈥檓 not sure about in the document.

Body Text
Use the TeX encoding of formatting characters:

Double quoting: ``Hello, World!''
Single quoting: `Hello, World!'
An en-dash: 1920---1942
An em-dash: Some thought -- sidenote -- same thought.
Double quoting: 鈥淗ello, World!鈥�
Single quoting: 鈥楬ello, World!鈥�
An en-dash: 1920鈥�1942
An em-dash: Some thought 鈥� sidenote 鈥� same thought.

(Yes, the last two are reversed from their positions in TeX. I think this is fair because a en-dash is far less common than an em-dash in my experience, but I鈥檇 appreciate feedback.)

Use format=flowed wrapping: if the line ends in a space, then the next line is treated as a continuation of the previous one. Otherwise there鈥檚 a line break.

Use the standard email conventions for strong and emphasis, and a new one for computer words (since I don鈥檛 think there exists a convention):

Emphasis (italics): I _love_ candy!
Strong (bold): *This is a draft!*
Code (monospaced): Use the |frobnitz| module.
Emphasis (italics): I love candy!
Strong (bold): This is a draft!
Code (monospaced): Use the frobnitz module.

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. Lines starting with $ or folowing a paragraph ending in :: are preformatted.

Headings
Headings start with 1 or more # characters. The level 1 heading (the title) starts with #, section headings with ##, subheads with ###, and so on.

Lists
Ordered lists start with numbers:

1. Jack
2. Jill
3. Bill
Jack
Jill
Bill
Unordered lists start with *:

* Eat
* Drink
* Sleep
Eat
Drink
Sleep
Block Quotes
Block quotes start with 3 or more spaces:

    Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this 
    continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the 
    proposition that all men are created equal.
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.
Links
I need to figure out some way of doing links. (A similar method could be used to do any other type of phrase-describing not included.) I was thinking something like:

[John] went to [the market].
 
[John] http://www.john.org/
[the market] http://themarket.gov/
John went to the market.

What do you think?

That鈥檚 it!
Is there anything else I should include? Let me know.
